        <h1>Product Design and Quality</h1>
        <p>When it comes to industry leading innovations in cycles and accessories, Vicious Cycle products are what you have been waiting for. We sell top quality cycling equipment and have been doing it for years. Our products have become the supply line of choice and lesser companies have been copying us for some time. Don't be fooled by imitators, Vicious Cycles is the real deal. Don't settle for second best when it comes to your cycling needs, but don't feel you have to raid your savings. Vicious Cycle Products is a name you can put your trust into, at a price you can afford. Of course, Custom Work is another thing entirely. At Vicious Cycles, we are not interested in a "Race to the Bottom" when it comes to creating custom builds. If you're interested in discussing a fully-custom or customized build, come down to our store and visit with us to find out what we can really do.</p>
   <h1>Trade Shows</h1>
        <p>We exhibit at several trade shows every year.  We are at home in the indoor showroom, but we believe the real showroom can only be found out on and off the road. Cycling is a lifestyle- Live Your Life</p>
